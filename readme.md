Run script on the PI:
`python lights.py pi camera`

`python lights.py debug camera`

Other flags instead of `camera` include `video` and `image`. You can pass a 3rd arg with an image name too.

Install Requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip freeze >> requirements.txt `
Run iPython:
`ipython -i lights.py`

PEP8 for style?
